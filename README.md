# ng-interview
## This is the goal:
Implement a Wikipedia search feature in this Angular app.

Ask the candidate to describe how they'd implement it.

Ideally they should mention using a `service` to encapsulate the Wiki search function and inject it to the directive.

Step 0: Clone repo to local (`cd` to desired directory first): `git clone git@github.com:tihuan/ng-interview.git`

Step 1: `cd ng-interview`

Step 2: Open the following two files for the candidate to work on: `searchPanel.directive.js` and `wikiSearch.service.js`.

Step 3: Pair program with the candidate and help them when necessary. Evaluate the candidate's web dev and communication skills along the way!

NOTE: branch `answer` has the answer, so please feel free to look at it before meeting candidates :)
